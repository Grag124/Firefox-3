# This repository now targets GitHub Codespaces and uses the container in `.devcontainer/`.
#
# The original Replit .replit configuration used by earlier versions of this repo
# has been intentionally disabled and replaced by Codespaces-friendly setup. If
# you'd like to run this project in Replit you may re-create an appropriate
# `replit.nix` or `.replit` configuration, but the recommended workflow is:
#
# 1) Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces (or rebuild the `.devcontainer`).
# 2) Rebuild the devcontainer so the required packages are installed (xvfb,
#    x11vnc, websockify, novnc, fluxbox, libgtk-3-0, etc.).
# 3) Run `bash scripts/codespace-run.sh` or use the devcontainer postStart action
#    which runs the one-shot setup automatically.

# This file has been preserved (disabled) so Replit users can use it as a
# starting point if they want to adapt the repository back to Replit. It is
# safe to delete this file from the repository entirely if you do not need it.
